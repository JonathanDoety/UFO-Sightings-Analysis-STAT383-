We plan to analyse global UFO sightings with a country's development to see if there is a relationship between the two. For this analysis, a country's "development" is quantified by its GDP per capita to account for the amount of people in the country. 

Data from: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gwenaelmouthuy/gdp-per-capita-between-1960-and-2021/ 

We will use the following R packages:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)

ufo <- read_csv(here("rawdata", "ufo-sightings-transformed.csv")) |> clean_names()
development <- read_csv(here("rawdata", "gdppercapita_us_inflation_adjusted.csv")) |> clean_names()

ggplot(ufo, aes(longitude, latitude)) + geom_point()

```
First, we'll plot a global ufo sightings map.
Now, I'd like to plot a map of just United States UFO sightings.
Use filter command on the ufo dataset to make a US sightings dataset.
Then plot it.
To make a block to code in do this: ```{r} #and to close it do this ```
